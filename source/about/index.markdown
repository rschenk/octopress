Hi there. My name is Ryan, and I am a well-rounded software developer, with a specialty in working with data. I have worked at Onset Computer Corporation, the world leader in data loggers, and for the scientific data repository at the MBL/WHOI Library. I enjoy figuring out how to store and process large amounts of data, but what I really love is making interfaces to explore this data in an elegant way. Once I  even turned scientific data into a gigantic interactive sculpture installation made of silk. ([Really](http://ryanschenk.com/2010/11/taxatron/)!)

I like to make everything, both digital and physical. Writing software is nice, because you get to build things without having to clean up afterwards, and I also enjoy working with my hands. I like to making things out of [wood](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschenk/sets/72157631632487936/), [metal](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschenk/sets/72157631799845938/), and [cloth](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschenk/sets/72157604989112911/); I've built [boats](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschenk/6468462645/in/photostream), [sails](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschenk/sets/72157631799602303/), [surfboards](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschenk/sets/72157622812244687/), and [sculptures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschenk/sets/72157628087715307/). It's really not so different than writing software, requiring planning around conflicting requirements, and competently using tools and skills you've acquired through practice and education.

I am available for freelance design, development, or data visualization projects. If you need help in any of these areas, please [contact me](mailto:rschenk@gmail.com).
