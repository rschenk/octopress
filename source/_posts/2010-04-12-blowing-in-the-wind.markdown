I recently entered two pieces into the Falmouth Artist Guild's April show, Blowing in the Wind. 

The first piece is a cascade of laser cut felt feathers, called Feather Vane.

The second piece is a slightly more conceptual mobile. It's a large wood and paper sail that holds a piece of charcoal on the end.

It is very delicately balanced so the charcoal just barely skitters across a paper-covered table. As the wind blows the sail around, it traces light marks on the paper.

As the exhibition progresses, the charcoal drawing will build up layer-by-layer. This is the progress after one week. Looking great!
