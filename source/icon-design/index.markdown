I used to work at [Onset Computer Corporation](http://www.onsetcomp.com/), where I had the privilege of designing the icons for their desktop and web-based software platforms. Although I don't design icons anymore, here are a few of my favorites.




![](http://ryanschenk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/icon.png)This little guy is for a Dashboard widget that I wrote called [PNGpong](http://ryanschenk.com/pngpong). That's a pretty nice ping pong paddle illustration, if I do say so myself.








![](http://ryanschenk.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/firmware-update.png)This is an application icon for a Firmware Update application that unfortunately was never built. I've heard rumors that they might be using it for a future application, which would be totally awesome.








![](http://ryanschenk.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/GPP.png)This is an icon for a plugin that calculates Grains Per Pound, a measurement for calculating mold spores present in the air.








![](http://ryanschenk.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/HOBOlink.png)This is a logo that I designed for a web application I was working on at the time. Unfortunately, it ended up getting scrapped.








![](http://ryanschenk.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/Secure-File-Icon.png)This is the icon for our encrypted datafiles that shows up in the Mac Finder/Windows Explorer. This is my favorite icon I've ever done.
